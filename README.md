# Object-tracking
This is a part of my second assignmnet in course EE5532.
The object tracker is based on the principle of correlation.This is an example of tracking by detection.This algorithm reduces the region of search in each frame.
The read_video_frames.m reads frames of the test video while the tracking_ball contains code to perform tracking
